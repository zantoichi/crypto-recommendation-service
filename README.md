## üê≥ Docker Image Generation

The project supports generating a Docker image using the `bootBuildImage` Gradle task. Docker daemon is required. Run
the following command to build the image:

```shell
./gradlew bootBuildImage
```

The generated Docker image contains the application and its dependencies.

## üõ°Ô∏è Rate Limiting

The service implements rate limiting to protect against abuse from malicious users.
Rate limiting is based on the IP address of the client making the requests.
By default, a maximum of 20 requests every 10 seconds per IP address is allowed,
but this is configurable.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application uses `application.yml` for configuration.
Below is an example configuration snippet:

```yaml

    reader:
        directory-path: src/main/resources/prices/
        file-suffix: _values.csv
        timestamp-header: timestamp
        symbol-header: symbol
        price-header: price
